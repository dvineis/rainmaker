      <h2>CHRIS JONES</h2>
      <p class="w3-opacity">West Region Sales Director</p>
      <h3 style="text-align:left;">Biography</h3>
      <p style="text-align:left;">
        Chris began his CPG career at the age of 20 when he was tapped to join Frito-Lay, Inc. a division of PepsiCo and a perennial top 100 member of the Fortune 500 list back when pagers, carbon paper and typewriters were the norm in business.
        <br><br>
        With his keen insights into customer needs and utilizing his enthusiasm for sales in the food and snacks arena, Chris has long endeavored to bring innovation, experimentation and ultimately profitable sales to everything he does in the Consumer-Packaged Goods Industry In all classes of trade with a variety of retailers and distributors throughout the US as well as Central Europe.
        <br><br>
        Progressing into various management roles with ever increasing responsibilities; including supervising a sales team of 16 professionals at the tender age of 23, Chris has had a hand in bringing about hundreds of millions of dollars in sales over a career spanning 3 decades and 6 companies and is still not finished.
        <br><br>
        Working in conjunction with buyers/distributors/brokers and manufactures as stakeholders on every major deal to identify and solve issues that may keep a product from succeeding in the marketplace, Chris has consistently won over accounts both large and small by treating everyone as if they were the “Big Fish”. Chris relishes being a team player in whatever role is necessary to do what’s right for the customer, the business and the consumer.
        <br><br>
        One of the highlights of his career was being tasked with moving to another state to manage a project with a national company as a partner to bring regional products to the market nationwide.
        <br><br>
        Over the course of an entire year, working through every possible scenario that could go wrong, he was successful with the alliance project and after working on a template to go national, he then co-managed a launch of initially 8 SKU’s into all 50 states plus overseas using over 16,000 DSD Routes.
